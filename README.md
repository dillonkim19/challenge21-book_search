DESCRIPTION
-----------
Most modern websites are driven by two things: data and user demands. This shouldn't come as a surprise, as the ability to personalize user data is the cornerstone of real-world web development today. And as user demands evolve, applications need to be more performant.

This application is a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with GraphQl API and Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API. 

USING THE APPLICATION
---------------------
Work in progress deployment.
